    summary: Submit a script for asynchronous execution
    description: Schedules script execution on the specified target. The execution is asynchronous, the call returns
                 as soon as the task is submitted. While the target is a single asset, it could be a composite one,
                 such as a cluster. It is up to the script to handle such targets properly.
